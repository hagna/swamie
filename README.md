This generates a program that generates a random quote. Kevin Lawler's
http://kevinlawler.com/prompts inspired this, if you can call it that.

"fortune" does this already except it needs a fortunes file every time.  This
needs a fortunes file the first time you run it.  The program you build from
the output will need enough memory from the OS to hold all of your fortunes,
gigabytes of fortunes are probably too much for a single human unlucky enough
to find this.
